Metastasis Segmentation Using Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net
Project Overview
This project is centered on segmenting brain metastases from medical images using two advanced deep learning architectures: Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net. These models are optimized for high-precision segmentation, which is crucial for identifying metastases in brain scans and supporting clinical diagnosis.

Both models are trained on labeled datasets and designed to precisely identify metastasis regions, enhancing the detection process for medical professionals.

Model Architectures
Nested U-Net
Nested U-Net, often referred to as U-Net++, builds on the original U-Net by incorporating dense connections between the encoder and decoder layers. These connections allow the model to capture contextual information at different scales, making it particularly effective for segmenting intricate structures in medical images.

Advantages: Enhanced segmentation performance due to multi-scale feature extraction.
Use Case: Helps to improve the identification of metastasis with more precise boundary detection.
Attention U-Net
The Attention U-Net enhances the traditional U-Net by introducing attention gates that guide the model's focus to relevant areas of the image. This is especially useful when the metastases are small or challenging to distinguish from the surrounding tissues.

Advantages: Improves model focus on metastasis regions while suppressing background noise.
Use Case: Strengthens the segmentation process by selectively concentrating on metastasis regions.
Challenges in Brain Metastasis Segmentation
Segmenting brain metastases presents several challenges:

Small tumor size: Metastases are typically small and dispersed, making detection difficult.
High variability: Metastases differ in terms of size, shape, and location across different patients, complicating segmentation.
Class imbalance: Datasets often contain a far greater number of non-metastasis regions compared to metastasis regions, causing imbalances during training.
This implementation addresses these challenges with careful data preparation, strategic architectural choices, and robust post-processing methods.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch (depending on your preference)
Streamlit for user interface
OpenCV, PIL, and other image processing libraries
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/metastasis-segmentation.git
cd metastasis-segmentation
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the Streamlit user interface:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8501 to interact with the metastasis segmentation model.

Dataset Preparation
The project uses a dataset of annotated brain images.
Ensure your dataset is properly formatted with corresponding image-mask pairs. Adjust file paths in the code to point to your dataset.
Running the Code
To train the model, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --model nested_unet --epochs 50
Alternatively, switch to Attention U-Net with this command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --model attention_unet --epochs 50
After training, you can run segmentation on new images using:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --model attention_unet --input ./path_to_image
Addressing Challenges in Brain Metastasis Segmentation
Limited Data Availability: Medical data is often scarce and difficult to annotate.

Solution: To counter this, data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, rotation, scaling) were employed to artificially increase dataset diversity.
Complex Metastasis Boundaries: The small, irregularly shaped metastasis regions make segmentation challenging.

Solution: Nested U-Net’s dense connections, combined with Attention U-Net’s attention gates, enhance boundary detection and reduce the chances of false positives.
Class Imbalance: The dataset contains significantly more non-metastasis regions.

Solution: Class imbalance was tackled using focal loss, which gives higher weight to difficult-to-classify areas and improves overall segmentation accuracy.
